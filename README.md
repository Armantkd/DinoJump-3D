# The Green Team
Dino Jump 3D began as a straightforward idea, the basis of which was the unarguable charm of motion control. We wanted to create an uncomplicated experience both simple and satisfying and thus decided to base our project on the universally loved “Dinosaur Game”. It's a 3D model that allows the user to jump and move side to side with a mounted Arduino. Moreover, it includes items that enhance the games experience. Throughout its development, our goal was to understand and then refine the player experience. With this in mind, we focused on tasks such as optimizing the controller responsiveness, designing satisfying assets and animation, and creating fun and addictive gameplay. Overall, we achieved our goal of making a simple yet satisfying game and could not be happier with the final product that is Dino Jump 3D.
